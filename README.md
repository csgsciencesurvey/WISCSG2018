# About CSG-Wis Survey 2018

In early 2018, a post on Career Support Group (CSG) asking about the challenges faced by women in their work place/graduate school, got an overwhelming response. There were stories and struggles shared, but also support and willingness to take action. This led to the inception of Women in Science (WiS) sub-group of the PhD Career Support Group (CSG), a group of volunteers both women and men who care about the challenges faced by women in their lives. This survey is a part of an initiative to identify and address gaps in the support received by women researchers in a professional STEM environment.
