# WiS-CSG: Women in Science - Career Support Group

Women in Science (WiS) is a group of volunteers that evolved from the [StemPeers](http://www.stempeers.org/), previously known as PhD Career Support Group (CSG), who aim to highlight the different challenges faced by women in science. 

# About CSG-Wis Survey 2018

In early 2018, a post on StemPeers - previously known as Career Support Group (CSG) - asking about the challenges faced by women in their work place/graduate school, got an overwhelming response. There were stories and struggles shared, but also support and willingness to take action. This led to the inception of Women in Science (WiS), a group of volunteers both women and men who aim to highlight the challenges faced by women in their lives. This survey is a part of an initiative to identify and address gaps in the support received by women researchers in a professional STEM environment.
