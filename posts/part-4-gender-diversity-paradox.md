## Summary

Gender disparities still exist arguably in STEM research
environments. Statistics show considerable
gender inequality in the career advancement of women
professionals, specifically in the leadership levels in
both science and technology environments. USA
is among the top 10 countries with the highest
investment in STEM and total number of researchers
(4255 researchers per million inhabitants), however,
women accounted for less than 32% of the scientific
landscape across North America in 2015.
According to a report provided by the National Science
Foundation (NSF) in 2015, male participation (206,000)
surpassed female participation (123,000) in the
academic doctoral science and engineering workforce. 
The number of female students who earned
doctoral degrees in the US in the STEM fields has been
steadily increasing since 2004 and has been either
almost equal or even exceeded that of the male
doctoral graduates. Still women mostly hold junior
faculty positions (42.5%) as compared to senior faculty
roles (30.9%). In a study published by the National
Academy of Sciences females were underrepresented in high profile biology labs led by elite
male faculty where male grad students and postdocs
outnumbered their female counterparts by two to one
and three to one respectively. High performing female
labs, however, did not reflect this issue. Even
independent biomedical research fellowship programs
which provide an alternative path to lead a lab and
achieve non-tenure track positions, report evidence on
the presence of gender bias in a recent study published
in 2019.
Men win a major share of scholarly awards, while
women receive a higher proportion of teaching and
service accolades due to imbalanced representation.
The smaller pool of potential women nominees is not
because of the lack of talent. Nobel Prize winners and
trailblazers like Professor Donna Strickland and
Professor Frances Arnold have discussed the various
explicit and implicit barriers they faced over their
lifetime that impeded their scientific career
progression.
Although 62% of women earn PhDs in the life sciences,
77% do not have any women on their scientific
advisory boards. Another statistics from 2013-2017
shows that biotech IPOs consistently had women
underrepresented among their CEOs, boards of
directors, scientific advisory boards, and C-level
leaders etc. These issues highlight the view that
to claim leadership positions, women researchers have
to overcome significant gender bias and severe lack of
good mentorship to compete on an equal platform
with men.

To build a better knowledge base and uncover the
issues faced by women scientists, CSG-WiS launched
an international dialogue at the nexus of gender and
scientific research, with an aim to create new applied
knowledge and to help in the development of
evidence-based policies and practices. We gathered
data on the status of gender equity in academia and
industry through the personal experiences of 219
researchers residing across the world and 5 subject
areas. In the present article, we highlight gender gap in
academia and try to identify whether and why women
lack leadership opportunities. Moreover, we provide
recommendations on various avenues to nurture
women leadership and discuss how embracing
diversity can help us advance towards gender parity in
STEM.
