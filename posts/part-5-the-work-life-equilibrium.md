## Summary

Workplaces, especially academia, rarely
have measures in place to ensure that employees can
achieve work-life balance in the STEM field. Long (often
unconventional) work hours and poor pay of early
career scientists make it hard on young researchers to
sustain this balancing act, whether they are men or
women. Couple this with the fact that women of child
bearing age need some special allowances during
pregnancy, child birth and child rearing, it adds an extra
layer of complication in trying to balance oneâ€™s personal
and professional life. There is evidence that there are
fewer women in research and that women quit their
careers in science in pursuit of motherhood.
Further, children are more likely to hurt the income of
women but not men. Even in Scandinavia, which is
considered to foster an extremely family friendly work
environment, women who work full-time are paid 15
percent to 20 percent less than men - a gender pay gap
similar to that in the United States. A part of the
reason for this is that women with children take up less
competitive jobs with typically lower pay or work parttime. But the decrease in pay is not proportional to the
cutback on the hours. Why is this so? Why are career
and parenthood mutually exclusive for women?

This article summarizes the results of section 7 of the
CSG-WiS survey to assess the work-life balance policies
for women researchers in a professional environment.
219 participants were asked four questions to
understand if:
- Workplace policies help them to manage their
professional and personal lives
- Supervisors were supportive of their personal lives
- Workplace had policies in place for taking
parental/sick/ personal leave of absence
- Workplace offered childcare related support
