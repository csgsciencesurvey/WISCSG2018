## Summary

In this article, we analyze the
conscious or unconscious gender-bias and/or
harassment of women in a professional environment.
Gender bias is discrimination of an individual based on
their gender. It can be (i) conscious or unconscious
(CSG-WiS Survey: Bias I) and (ii) subtle or obvious.
Harassment is unwelcome conduct that is based on sex,
race, color, religion, age, etc. According to U.S. Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), gender
bias and harassment based on sex become deleterious
and/or unlawful where, 1) enduring the offensive
conduct becomes a condition of continued
employment, or 2) the conduct is severe or pervasive
enough to create a work environment that a
reasonable person would consider intimidating, hostile,
or abusive. 

Our focus was on Bias-I subsection of the CGS-WiS
survey - conscious or unconscious gender-bias and/or
harassment at the workplace. The survey had two
questions - whether the person has faced gender-bias
or discrimination from male (Q26) and/or female (Q27)
colleagues. There were five options to pick from: 1)
Yes, 2) No, 3) Not sure, 4) Not available, and 5) Do not
wish to answer. 85.4% and 82.6% of the participants
answered either ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ respectively, and
therefore, we primarily compared these two responses
with each other. We shortlisted 17 questions and then
explored how they were associated with participants
who experienced bias from those who did not. For
each of these 17 questions, we further split them
according to “Yes” or “No” or “Not sure” responses
from Bias 1. For each observation, Fisher's exact test
was applied to calculate a statistical significance and
only significant results have been discussed in this
article.
