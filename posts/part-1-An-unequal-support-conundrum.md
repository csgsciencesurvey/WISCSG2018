## Summary

It is inevitable that the support one receives from
mentors, co-workers and the workplace environment
plays a major role in shaping up one’s career. Surveys
point to the skewed nature of women/girl participation
in STEM careers - not because of a paucity of talent but
several other factors including social and cultural values,
lack of adequate mentoring and workplace support in
general. Most individual success stories, along with self
initiative of course, highlight the significance of a
mentor. 

The Career Support Group - Women in Science (CSGWiS) survey series is an attempt to gather and
understand quantitative and qualitative data about
work environments as experienced by women and men
with advanced degrees. The survey asked respondents
about the ‘level of support’ they received in their
respective work environments from group leaders
(similar to a supervisor in some settings), colleagues,
collaborators, clients and family members. ‘Gender’ of
the mentor, colleague, collaborator or family member
was a variable the respondents had to consider.
