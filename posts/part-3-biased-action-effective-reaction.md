## Summary

Bias and harassment in all forms can be very detrimental
to one’s performance at work and personal well-being.
Scientific organizations vastly focus on how we conduct
research and how we publish them, but sadly, bias
incidents are not treated as seriously as research
misconducts. Policies such as Title IX and Nondiscrimination in Employment Practices in Education in the USA, POSH act 2013 in India and
European Commission’s gender equality law and
Employment Equality Directive aim to ensure equal
opportunities and gender equality in decision making
positions, closing gender pay gap, and ending
harassment. Despite such strong measures, inequality
and bias exist in workplaces and beyond. The
Eurobarometer survey conducted in EU countries 
showed that their respondents exhibit discriminative
behaviors based on gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation,
disability, religious belief, and older age. As per Implicit
Project led by Harvard’s global online research, over
two-thirds of the online-test participants (men and
women) are gender-biased and tend to think that men
are better suited for professional careers than women,
who are better as homemakers. Women are often
the targets of sexual harassment; people of color deal
with racial bias; LGBTQ+ community experience
emotional harassment; and those who belong to
multiple marginalized groups such as queer women of
color simultaneously experience multiple disadvantages
and face more bias-related incidents. In the #metoo
movement era, academics have also come forward
to acknowledge the damages caused by gender bias,
discrimination and sexual harassment.

In this article, we assess responses and actions against
bias and other forms of harassment (sexual, mental,
emotional etc.), henceforth indicated by ‘bias incidents’,
experienced or witnessed by researchers at their
workplaces. We also assess the outcome of reporting
such incidents, challenges associated with them and
further recommendations to address them. This report
is a part of the survey that was conducted under the title
“Support Received by Women in Research (CSG-WiS)”.
We gathered 219 responses covering a wide
demographic, age, social status, research background,
positions, and workplaces. For the gender aspect,
statistically significant data is available to evaluate two
genders: men and women. Insufficient data makes it
inconclusive to state anything about other genders. 197
of our respondents are Indian nationals (including the
authors), therefore a few observations might be
influenced by this factor. A large proportion of our
respondents are located in India and the USA, however
several participants are also nationals or residents of
other parts of Americas (Canada, Mexico etc.), European
countries (mainly from United Kingdom, Germany, and
the Czech Republic), and other Asian countries
(Singapore, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka). Finally,
although this report focuses on identifying support for
women in research, recommendations listed in this
article are applicable for supporting members of other
marginalized groups as well.
