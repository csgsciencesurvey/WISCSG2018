# Analysis of survey data from the 'Bias I & II' sections

## Data analysis for the responses categorised in the section "Bias I"

### Here we analyse two sets of survey response data:
1. If our survey responders experienced bias at their workplace from their colleagues
2. If our survey responders witnessed bias at their workplace from their colleagues
We have combined the responses to non-gender specifically identify such bias based on their nationality and
country of residence. Furthermore, we have separately analyzed gender specific datasets as shown below.

## Data analysis for the responses categorised in the section "Bias II"

### Here we try to assess the reaction towards or action taken against gender-bias/harassment experienced or
witnessed by our survey takers. The questions we asked in this categories are:

1. Did you personally respond to the incident?
2. Did you report the issue to the appropriate authority?
3. Who is responsible for addressing such complaints in your work environment?
4. How seriously were your complaints taken?
5. How comfortable were you in objecting against and/or reporting this issue?
6. Was there any POSITIVE impact/outcome from reporting the incident? (e.g. positive change in policy,
setting an example for others, support from colleagues, better work environment etc.)
7. Was there any NEGATIVE impact/outcome from reporting the incident? (e.g. threats, grudges,
emotional-distress, isolation at work, disapproval of colleague(s), unfriendly work environment etc.)
